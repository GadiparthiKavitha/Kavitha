Quickstart: Get started with Language Studio
Language Studio is a set of UI-based tools that lets you explore, build, and integrate features from Azure Cognitive Service for Language into your applications.

Language Studio provides you with a platform to try several service features, and see what they return in a visual manner. It also provides you with an easy-to-use experience to create custom projects and models to work on your data. Using the Studio, you can get started without needing to write code, and then use the available client libraries and REST APIs in your application.

Get started using Language Studio
[!INCLUDE deploy an Azure resource]

Language Studio pre-configured features
The Language service offers multiple features that use prebuilt, pre-configured models for performing various tasks such as: entity linking, language detection, and key phrase extraction. See the Azure Cognitive Service for Language overview to see the list of features offered by the service.

Each of these features has a demo-like experience inside Language Studio that lets you input text, and presents the response both visually, and in JSON. These demos help you quickly test these prebuilt features without using code.

Language Studio customizable features
The Language service also offers multiple features that let you create, train, and deploy custom models to better fit your data. For example, custom content classification and custom question answering. For features with customization, Language Studio offers workflows that let developers and subject matter experts build models without needing machine learning expertise.

Clean up resources
If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.
